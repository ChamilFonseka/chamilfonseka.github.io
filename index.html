    <p>I am a software engineer with 13 years of experience, specializing in the Java ecosystem, particularly Spring and Spring Boot. I have extensive experience in creating cloud-native microservices using Spring Boot, AWS Cloud, Docker, and Kubernetes. My background includes working with relational databases as well as NoSQL databases like Cassandra, MongoDB, and Redis. I am passionate about Kafka and event-driven architecture, love Python, and enjoy exploring generative AI with LangChain. Additionally, I am enthusiastic about creating interactive UIs with Angular and React. I am also a team player, well-versed in agile practices and methodologies.</p>
